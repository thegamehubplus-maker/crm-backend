"""Initialize the database package.

This file signals to Python that the ``db`` directory is a package. It
doesn't need to contain any code, but having this file present makes it
possible to import modules from the ``db`` package using dotted
notation (e.g., ``from app.db import session``). Keeping it empty is
intentional.
